Week 0 Challenge: Artificial Intelligence Mastery
Overview
This repository hosts my solution for the 10 Academy Week 0 Challenge, which focuses on leveraging Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and statistical techniques to derive actionable insights from solar radiation data across Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo. The aim is to identify optimal regions for solar energy investment and support sustainable development initiatives.

Objectives
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to discover trends and insights.
Use statistical analysis to validate the results and substantiate recommendations.
Develop a user-friendly Streamlit dashboard for interactive visualization of findings.
Implement Git and GitHub for effective version control and CI/CD workflows.
Dataset Description
The dataset provides measurements on:

Solar radiation metrics: Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI), Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI).
Environmental parameters: Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Precipitation, etc.
Sensor-related data: Module performance, Cleaning events, etc.
Key Deliverables
1. Git and GitHub Integration
Configure the development environment and set up Python dependencies.
Utilize Git for source control and configure CI/CD pipelines for automated workflows.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Compute descriptive statistics and identify significant patterns.
Visualize data distributions and relationships using heatmaps and scatter plots.
Analyze time-series trends for key metrics, including GHI and DNI.
Handle missing data and mitigate outliers to ensure analysis integrity.
3. Interactive Streamlit Dashboard (Optional)
Build an interactive web app using Streamlit to present insights.
Enable user interaction via sliders, filters, and other widgets.
Deploy the dashboard to the Streamlit Community Cloud for public accessibility.
